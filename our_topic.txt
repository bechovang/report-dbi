3. Library Management System
Consider the following set of requirements for a database that is used to manage a library.
The library stores information about books, including book ID, title, subject category, and
publication year. A book may have multiple authors.
Information about authors includes author ID, name, nationality, and year of birth. An author
may write multiple books.
Each book may have multiple copies, identified by copy ID, condition, and status. A copy can be
borrowed by only one member at a time.
Information about publishers includes publisher ID, name, address, and contact number. Each
book is published by one publisher.
Library members have a member ID, name, address, phone number, and membership type.
Members may borrow multiple books. Each loan record stores borrow date, due date, return
date, and overdue fine if applicable. Fines are calculated per day overdue.
The system must support reports on most borrowed books, member borrowing history, overdue
items, and book statistics by author or publisher
