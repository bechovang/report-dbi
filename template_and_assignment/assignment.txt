ASSIGNMENT
Grouping
• Each group must have a minimum of 3 students.
Task
• Choose one of following topics for a database application (see the attached list).
• Design and implement the database to store data for this project. You need to:
1. Write the user requirement (summarizes the selected design requirements, and
may remove some non-critical details).
2. Design E/R diagram (find entity sets, attributes, and relationships in your
project -> make ERD).
3. Convert E/R diagram to relational data model. Normalize this to 3NF.
4. Define all necessary constraints.
5. Implement this design into SQL Server.
6. Insert data into the database. Write all the SQL statements, functions, stored
procedures, and triggers to perform all the necessary transactions of the
application.

- List of students.
- Problems (write the user requirement).
- Project Scope & Tools.
Report 1: Decomposition
- Team Involvements.
- Entity sets: ...
- Relationships: ...
- Attributes (determining what belongs
to each entity set)
-> make E/R diagram.
Report 2: Pattern Recognition
- Team Involvements.
- Convert E/R diagram to relational data
model.
- Look for repeating patterns or rules in
data -> Indicates which relation schema
is not normalized.
Report 3: Abstraction
- Team Involvements
- Represent observed patterns as
Functional Dependencies (FDs) ->
Normalize the Database Schema to 3NF.

LMSReport 4: Algorithm Design
- Team Involvements.
- Build normalized tables with primary
keys, foreign keys, and additional
constraints if applicable.
- Implement this design into SQL
Server.
Report 5: Final Project Report
- Team Involvements
- Insert data into the database.
- Write all the SQL statements,
functions, stored procedures, and
triggers to perform all the necessary
transactions of the application.
- Final Thoughts.
.SQL file
All T-SQL source code used in the
project
- Create database, tables and constraints
- Insert data into the database
- Execute SQL queries, triggers (to set
up complex constraints), functions and
procedures (to solve business) ect.

Available AI Tools
1> Database Design:
- ChatGPT/ Copilot: Ask AI to suggest E/R diagrams or normalize tables.
- draw.io + AI plugins (e.g. DiagramGPT): Generate E/R diagrams.
2> SQL Practice & Debugging:
‐ AI SQL Tutor (like Text2SQL models): Convert natural language to SQL queries.
‐ Students can paste broken SQL queries into AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) for
debugging and explanation.
